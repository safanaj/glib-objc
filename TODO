* figure out how overriding vfuncs will work -- will wrappers have
  to do this more or less manually?  maybe -- wappers could have empty impl
  that fwds to the gobject; objc classes will need to chain up -- but how will
  gobject C code know how to get to the objc vfuncs (think setting the
  default signal handler in a subclass)?
* figure out how to implement GInterfaces in objc code
* reexamine the -setData:forKey: and getDataForKey: API
* do we need to implement wrappers for _set/get_qdata(), _weak_retain/release(),
  _toggle_ref/unref()?
* enum/flags gtype registration?  or just leave them generic and use GLIBValue's
  enum/flags support?
* maybe expose some useful stuff like _gvalue_from_nsobject() and
  _nsobject_from_gvalue()
